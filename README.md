Dog Status (working title) is an app used to track walks with your dog(s). This can be useful for situations where you or your spouse need to remember when the dog(s) were let out last, and did they use the bathroom.

Future feature goals will include:
* logging in as a user (helpful for spouses, or friends that come over and let the dogs out for you)
* adding pictures of the dog(s)
* Sharing of walks via text message or other means

## Current To-Do's (Updated 12/19/2019)
* [ ] Build out functionality for starting a walk
    * [ ] start time counter
    * [ ] increment in seconds
* [ ] Build out functionality for ending a walk
    * [ ] log ending time
    * [ ] log total elapsed time
    * [ ] Post times to db
* [ ] Set up MongoDB
    * [ ] Set up user collection and associated attributes
* [ ] Set up Express
    * [ ] plan out routes
    * [ ] implement routes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
